# Water Quality Indicators

The Water Quality Indicators (WQI) Project integrates and normalizes available ambient monitoring data to help EPA, state, and tribal staff better identify water quality problem areas. EPA currently publishes information about watersheds health based on assessments made by states under the Clean Water Act (CWA) 305(b) program. Those data reside in EPA ATTAINS and contain information about impaired watersheds (CWA 303(d)). Because a large number of watersheds have not yet been assessed, EPA began the WQI project to fill in data gaps. Specifically, statistics of ambient water data in the Water Quality Portal (Portals)EXIT are generated and compared by the WQI project to national or ad hoc water quality criteria (currently only nutrient concentrations). EPA used data analytic methods to stratify the Portals data, and is now working to include data visualization tools that will help users display, better understand, and assess the data. EPA envisions a wide-ranging set of uses for the data, including trend analysis, Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) development, and improved state and local permitting and compliance program administration. EPA is releasing a beta version of the database and methodology to receive feedback from interested individuals.
